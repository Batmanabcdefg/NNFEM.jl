# Plasticity

We generate 10 sets of data for training the neural network (100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204), 4 sets of data for validating (105, 106, 205, 206) and 1 set of data for testing (300). The setting are as follows (the arrows represents force direction but may indicate different force magnitude; the shaded area indicates fixed sides).
